# Face-Recognition-in-Images

# It detects faces from the image and recognizes the label(name) of the person. The rule is simple more the images in training more the accuracy in the testing.In training process we give more than 50 images to the recognizer so it can learn the different faces of the same person. 

# Dataset:
More than 50 images of each person.

# Classifier:
1. LBPH Face Recognizer

# Pre-Requisits:
Must have Python3 installed.

Must have Numpy module installed.
Must have OS module installed.

# Instructions to run:
1. First clone the project
2. Make your training and testing data.
